MemToolbox2D 1.0.0.

The MemToolbox2D is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual
working memory in two-dimensional data. 
The functions here are adapted from MemToolbox 1.0.0 (Suchow, Brady, 
Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013; memtoolbox.org) and require the full MemToolbox 
1.0.0 to be in the matlab path.

If you wish to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your 
research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed using the 
MemToolbox2D (Grogan et al., 2019; Suchow et al., 2013)." and

Dependencies:
1. The MemToolbox 1.0.0 (MemToolbox.org) is needed for the main functionality.
2. The Statistics Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/) is
   needed for all of the major functionality of the toolbox.
3. The parallel computing toolbox is recommended.
