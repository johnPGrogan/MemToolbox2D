MemToolbox2D 1.0.0.

The MemToolbox2D is a collection of MATLAB functions for modeling visual
working memory in two-dimensional data. 
The functions here are adapted from MemToolbox 1.0.0 (Suchow, Brady, 
Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013; memtoolbox.org) and require the full MemToolbox 
1.0.0 to be in the matlab path.

If you wish to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your 
research, you might say something like, "Data analysis was performed using the 
MemToolbox2D (Grogan et al., 2019; Suchow et al., 2013)." and

Dependencies:
1. The MemToolbox 1.0.0 (MemToolbox.org) is needed for the main functionality.
2. The Statistics Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/) is
   needed for all of the major functionality of the toolbox.
3. The parallel computing toolbox is recommended.
4. It was developed in Matlab R2018b, and works in R2019b. It does not run in R2021, as the mle.m function 
has been updated, and now requires the input to be a vector rather than a structure. You can either use 
an earlier version of matlab, or modify the mle.m function as suggested in this issue 
(https://github.com/visionlab/MemToolbox/issues/31) although that could interfere with other scripts using mle.m
